# Introduction

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.

# Observations

The bar chart displayst 25 unique mice tested on each drug regimen.

The pie chart shows that female versus male mice's was equally distributed.

From the box plot graph, we can see that Ramicane and Capomulin are more effective in treating tumors can be more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
